# React-Book-Database

A simple React based application to learn about different hooks.

In case anyone want to test the application,

- Get the code and open it in your code editor.
- Open 2 instances of the terminal.
- Type 'npm run server' and press [ENTER] to initialise the json-db.
- Type 'npm run dev' to run the app on localhost.

## How to use

Enter a book name and press [ENTER] or click on Submit button to add it in the database.
The app will assign a random image as the book cover.
Once the instance is added, you can either edit the title or delete it from the database.
